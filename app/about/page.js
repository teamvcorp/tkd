                This kid- who I normally have to push out the door to get
                anywhere on time- is literally pulling me out to get to training
                on time. The lessons are a great mix of physical fitness,
                technique building, lessons that apply both on and off the mat.
                And weâ€™re making new friends- always a bonus!"

                Von Der Becke, 4th degree black belt, has created an atmosphere
                where I am getting off my butt, working out and having a great
                time doing it. He changes the sessions every time so it is
                always something challenging. I appreciate his ability to adjust
                the sessions based on ability and injury level (I am getting up
                there and don't move like I used to) Make no mistake this is an
                intense workout and is what you make of it. I am grateful to
                find such a class and instructor so close to home!
